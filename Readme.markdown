Playground
==========

This is a playground for myself.

The codes here are basically *ALL* template generated code from Xcode (or other tools).

The projects here are just for fun (and as reminders to myself), and may be not mature for production.

iOS

**NavBar Message**

*Mimic the info bar that can automatically hide, which can be used to replace UIAlertView or HUD in some occasions.*

A small info bar usually under navbar, which shows info to users, it will automatically hide itself within some seconds.

Know issue: View resize behavior is not right while rotating the device.

**ARC Shadow Table View**

*Shadow Table View originally by [Cocoa with love](http://www.cocoawithlove.com/2009/08/adding-shadow-effects-to-uitableview.html), remastered with ARC (and only ARC).*

This is the sample project to add shadows to tableview. 

The main class file are `ShadowTableView.h` && `ShadowTableView.m`. 

`GradientView.h` and `GradientView.m` are for table view cell gradient background.

**Empty for now.**

(More projects to come.)
